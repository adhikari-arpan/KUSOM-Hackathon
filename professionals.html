        <p> 1.Focus on your most unhappy customers. <br>

            2. Use the technology to gather rich information on their unhappy experiences with your product and to find out what they want you to put into the product. <br>
            
            3. Use technology to drive the news to the right people in hurry. <br>
            If you use these three things, you'll turn those draining, bad news experiences into an exhilarating process of improving your product or service. Unhappy customers are always concern. They're also your greatest opportunity. Adopting a learning posture rather than a negative defensive posture can make customer complaints your best source of significant quality improvements...
